<h2>Launch homebrews by taking advantage of the 3 GB of RAM</h2>
&nbsp;
<p>
To use some homebrews as Pplay, it is recommended to launch the homebrews menu using the switch's 3GB ram. In general, it is better to use this method to launch homebrews. To do this, the method of launching the homebrew menu with ram varies according to the payload used:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Under SX OS it is necessary to maintain "R" by launching a game under SX OS. If it is via an XCI for this method to work, it must first be mounted.</li>
<li>Under the latest versions of Atmosphere, as for SX OS, you must keep the "R" button pressed by launching a game installed on the console. Moreover, to launch the Homebrew Menu from the album, it is also necessary to maintain "R" by launching it.
<br/>
Info: The "R" button must be held after selecting the account that the game will launch (if the game works this way because some games proceed differently in which case the "R" button must be held when clicking on the game icon). So the best thing to do is to hold down the "R" button just before clicking on the game icon and release it once the Homebrew Menu is launched.</li>
<li>For ReiNX, you need to download <a target="_new" href="https://gbatemp.net/threads/homebrew-menu-loader-legal-nsp.518433/">the NSP of the HBMenu</a> and then install it with Goldleaf or any other homebrew to install NSP. Once this is done, you will have access to the Homebrew Menu directly via the Switch's game icons and the 3 GB of RAM will be used.
<br/>
Note: This method is compatible with all CFWs but for SX OS it is useless in my opinion and for Atmosphere it is possible to do otherwise so install this NSP must be done if no alternative method suits you.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h2>Use Kezplez-nx (now Lockpick but the operation is almost the same)</h2>
&nbsp;
<p>
This homebrew allows you to dump the different keys used by Hactool and other derivatives. Be careful, do not share the "prod.keys" file obtained thanks to this homebrew because it contains console-specific keys such as the tsec_key for example. Kezplez-nx is a little special because it requires you to dump some console-specific files before you can use it. 
<br/><br/>
Note: Now it is better to use the Lockpick-RCM payload to dump these keys, there is no need for anything but an SD in the console and to launch the payload via the RCM mode of the Switch and the keys will be dumped. Also note that for firmware 7.0.0 and above, you will also need to have Sept on the SD (available for example in the latest releases of Atmosphere, do not copy the file "payload.bin" in if you do not use Atmosphere) so that all keys are dumped. 
<br/><br/>
Here's how to use Kezplez-NX or Lockpick: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>Dump the files "fuses.bin" and "tsec_keys.bin" with the Hekate version included in this script. These dump options will be found in the "Console info" menu ("Print fuse info" and "Print TSEC keys") and you will have to press the "Power" button once the info is displayed to dump it on the SD in the "/Backup/[an_hexadecimal_number]/Dumps" folder or otherwise in the "/Backup/Dumps" folder.</li>
<li>For 1.X to 2.3.0 included firmwares (Kezplez-NX): Try using the "debug" option in the Hekate configuration file (not tested) or use the latest version of Atmosphere. Otherwise, if it doesn't work, in Hekate, go to "Tools" then "Backup" then "Backup eMMC BOOT0/1" and in "Tools" then "Dump package1/2". Once these dumps are done, copy the obtained files into the "/switch/kezplez-nx" folder of the SD. Note: With Lockpick, the debug option needs to be enabled on all firmwares to make full key dumps.</li>
<li>In case of a bug with Lockpick, it is also possible to dump the Bis keys on the SD with the payload Biskeydump V7 (version present in my script) and leave it at the root of the SD so that Lockpick can use it.</li>
<li>Launch the homebrew, press "A" and voil√†, the keys will be in the file "prod.keys", at the root of the SD for Kezplez-NX and in the folder "switch" for Lockpick.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h2>Optional homebrews</h2>
&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>appstore: Install, update or delete homebrews from the Switch simply.</li>
<li>Awoo-Installer: A NSP/NSZ/XCI/XCZ installer based on Adube's Tinfoil.</li>
<li>BiggestDump: Allows you to dump the current firmware of the console or the one waiting for installation. This can be useful used in conjunction with ChoiDuJour-NX to install the EXFAT driver quite simply.</li>
<li>Checkpoint: Allows you to save/restore game backups.</li>
<li>ChoiDuJourNX: Update the console without burning Efuses (never launch an update with the official bootloader once installed because the Efuses will be burned) or downgrade the console (same remark as for the update except that if the firmware is launched by the official bootloader and the number of Efuses does not match the console will not launch the firmware, you must go through ReiNX or Hekate or others).</li>
<li>EbookViewerNX: Read some ebooks formats.</li>
<li>EdiZon: A game backup editor.</li>
<li>EmuMMC-Toggle: Enable/disable the Atmosphere emunand (emummc).</li>

<li>Haku33: Reset the console by default settings, remove all data on the nand.</li>
<li>incognito : Allows you to delete the identification data from the console to avoid banning it from the console. Be careful, once this is done it will no longer be possible to use Nintendo's online services unless you restore the PRODINFO partition of the console so keep a backup of this partition, either by uploading it via Hekate or NxNandManager or by keeping the backup that will be made when using this homebrew. This partition being encrypted with the Bis Keys of the console, the PRODINFO of one console cannot be exchanged with another PRODINFO of another console.</li>
<li>JKSV: Another backup manager.</li>
<li>LinkUser: Allows you to link a Nintendo account unofficially, be careful because this will delete all the accounts on the console so dump the game backups (Checkpoint or EdiZon) and then re-inject them.</li>
<li>Lockpick: Allows you to dump the different keys used by Hactool and other derivatives. Be careful, do not share the file "keys.txt" (or "prod.keys") obtained thanks to this homebrew because it contains console-specific keys such as tsec_key for example. This homebrew also allows you to dumper the title keys installed on the console.</li>
